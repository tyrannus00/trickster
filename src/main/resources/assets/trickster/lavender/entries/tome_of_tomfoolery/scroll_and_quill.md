The Scroll and Quill can be used to easily write and store complex and reusable spells.


Right-clicking it opens the [Spell-Scribing](^trickster:editing) interface, letting you directly modify the contained spell.


Scrolls can be stored in a [Top Hat](^trickster:top_hat) for easy access and safe-keeping.

;;;;;

The written spell can be read from the scroll by means of [Notulist's Delusion](^trickster:basic_tricks#4).
It is also possible to write to a scroll programmatically using [Notulist's Ploy](^trickster:basic_tricks#5)

A Scroll and Quill can be signed by shift-right-clicking it.

;;;;;

Signed scrolls are immutable. They cannot be written to by any means. However, they can be charged with one to eight vials of spell ink, 
a special concoction that imbues scrolls with a single-use pool of mana. 
Scrolls that have been imbued with mana can have their contained spell cast at no risk to the user, however, doing so consumes the scroll. 

;;;;;

Single-use scrolls have an internal buffer of mana with a capacity equivalent to the amount of spell ink used in their making, times 100.

Do Not Consume!
